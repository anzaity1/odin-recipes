    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>                              
        <ul>
            <li> 1 1/4lbs flank steak thinly sliced</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon vegetable oil divided use</li>
            <li> 2 cups broccoli florets</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup beef broth or water</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
     
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the broccoli and cook for approximately 4 minutes or until tender.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 30 seconds more.</li>
            <li>Remove the broccoli from the pan; place on a plate and cover.</li>
            <li>Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and turn the heat to high. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil.</li>
            <li> Season the steak pieces with salt and pepper and add them to the pan in a single layer - you may need to do this step in batches. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli mixture back to the pan and cook for 2 more minutes or until warmed through.</li>
            <li>In a bowl whisk together the oyster sauce, beef broth, sugar, sesame oil and soy sauce. In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water.</li>
            <li>Pour the oyster sauce mixture over the beef and vegetables; cook for 30 seconds. Add the cornstarch and bring to a boil; cook for 1 more minute or until sauce has just started to thicken.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, with rice if desired.</li>
        </ol>
